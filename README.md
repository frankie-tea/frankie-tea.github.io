# Coding in the cloud 

## Sites for poor sight

I can't remember if I have the vim extensions installed... looks like it I navigate with hjkl and switch on and off with i and escape.

I now need to remember the markdown tags beyond #

I would like to mark up some code... wheres that again?

[Link to markdown cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

I hope that link works above...
